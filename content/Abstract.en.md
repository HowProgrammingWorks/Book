# Abstract

All programs are data. Some data are interpreted as values or as types of these
values, others – as instructions for processing the first ones. All programming
paradigms and techniques are just a method to form metadata that gives the rules
and control flow order of data processing. Multi-paradigm programming approach
takes the best of all paradigms to build syntactic constructions, which allow
describing the subject domain more clearly and conveniently. We reflect
high-level DSLs (domain languages) into low-level machine instructions through
many layers of abstractions. There is no need to fanatically follow any
paradigm. It’s important to represent the task in the most efficient way for
execution at the machine level. This includes a less amount of layers and
dependencies as well as fulfillment of the following requirements:
human-readable, maintainable and modifiable, ensuring code reliability and
testability, extensibility, reusability, clarity and flexibility of metadata
constructs at every level. We believe that such an approach will allow us to get
both quick first results in the development, and not lose performance with a
large flow of changes at mature and complex project stages. We will try to
consider the techniques and principles of different programming paradigms
through the prism of metaprogramming and thereby change if not the software
engineering itself, but at least its understanding by new generations of
engineers.
