## 1.6. Software Engineer Profession Overview

Around programming, as around any sphere of human activity, people have managed to build an enormous number of prejudices and misconceptions. The primary source of problems is terminology, as various paradigms, languages, and ecosystems impose their own terminology, which is not only contradictory between each other, but also illogical even within individual communities. Moreover, many self-taught programmers and loners invent unique, incomparable terminology and concepts that duplicate each other. Aggressive marketers also destructively influence the IT industry as a whole, on the formation of worldview and terminology. By twisting obvious things, confusing and complicating concepts, they ensure an inexhaustible avalanche of problems on which the entire software business is sustained. By luring users and programmers to their technologies, industry giants often create very tempting and plausible concepts that ultimately lead to incompatibility, standards wars, and obvious dependence on software platform vendors. Groups that capture people's attention parasitize on their attention and budgets for decades. Driven by pride and vanity, some developers themselves spread questionable, and sometimes deliberately dead-end ideas. After all, making software well is completely unprofitable for the manufacturer. The situation is significantly better in the field of free software and open source, but decentralized enthusiasts are too fragmented to effectively counter the powerful propaganda of industry giants.

As soon as any technology or ecosystem develops sufficiently to create good solutions on it, it inevitably becomes obsolete or the manufacturer stops supporting it, or it becomes overly complex. In my memory, more than five such technological ecosystems have already changed.
